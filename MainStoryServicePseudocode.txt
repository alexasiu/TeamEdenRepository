RunMainService
(implements the state machine for MainStory Service)
The EventType field of ThisEvent will be one of: ES_INIT, ES_SEED_DETECTED, ES_F3_DONE, ES_TIMEOUT, ES_RESET, ES_DONE_INIT
Local Variables: NextState
 	Set NextState to CurrentState;
	Based on the state of the CurrentState variable choose one of the following blocks of code:
		CurrentState is InitMain:
			if ThisEvent is ES_INIT
				Reset the count of services done resetting to 0
				Set next state to wait4seed
		End InitMain block

		CurrentState is Wait4Seed_M: 
			if ThisEvent is ES_SEED_DETECTED
				Start the GAME_TIMER to GAME_TIME
				Set NextState to Wait4AllFlips
			else if ThisEvent is ES_RESET
				Post reset to all services
				Set NextState to Wait4Reset
		End Wait4Seed_M block
	
		CurrentState is Wait4AllFlips:
			if ThisEvent is ES_F3_DONE 
				Post to all services an ES_CELEBRATION event
				Start the celebration timer CELEB_TIMER to 10 seconds
				Set NextState to Celebrating
			else if ThisEvent is ES_TIMEOUT and it corresponds to GAME_TIMER
				Post reset to all services
				Set the next state to Wait4Reset
			else if ThisEvent is ES_RESET
				Post reset to all services
				Set NextState to Wait4Reset
			Endif
		End of Wait4AllFlips block
			
		CurrentState is Celebrating:
			If ThisEvent is a timeout (from game timer or celeb timer)
				Post reset to all services
				Set NextState to Wait4Reset
			else if ThisEvent is ES_RESET
				Post reset to all services
				Set NextState to Wait4Reset
			Endif
		End of Celebrating block

		CurrentState is Wait4Reset
			if ThisEvent is ES_DONE_INIT 
				Increment the counter to keep track of services done
				if all services are done (at least 6 counts)
					Post an ES_INIT event so all services can re-initialize
					Set NextState to InitMain
				Endif
			Endif
		End of Wait4Reset block
	End of SM
	Set CurrentState to NextState
  	return ReturnEvent;
